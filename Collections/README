Collection classes serve various purposes,such as allocating 
memory dynamically to elements and accessing a list of items on the basis of an index etc. 
These classes create collections of objects of the Object class.
which is the base class for all data types in C#

/*some group of same and diffrence object's, to store and retrive the data, we are using the collection*/ 
ex--[BAG]--we can put many diffrent item's 
[PEN]-- diffrente company are make diffrence type's of pen's
