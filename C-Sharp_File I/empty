A file is a collection of data stored in a disk with a specific name and a directory path.
When a file is opened for reading or writing.
it becomes a stream.
There are two main streams: the input stream and the output stream.
The input stream is used for reading data from file (read operation).
The output stream is used for writing into the file (write operation).
