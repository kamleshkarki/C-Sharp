/*
Abstraction is used to show only essential features.
	1.Abstraction is just opposite of Encapsulation. Abstraction is mechanism to show only relevant data to the user. 
	2.Consider the same mobile example again. Whenever you buy a mobile phone, 
	3.you see their different types of functionalities as camera, mp3 player, calling function, recording function, multimedia etc.
	4.It is abstraction, because you are seeing only relevant information instead of their internal engineering.

*/
For Ex-This is the Abstract Base Class.
 
     abstract class animal
    {
        public abstract void eat();
        public void sound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("dog can sound");
        }
    } 
 if we make both of its methods abstract then 
	this class would become a pure Abstract Base Class.we derive a class of 'dog' from the class animal.

    abstract class animal
    {
        public abstract void eat();
        public void sound()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("dog can sound");
        }
    }
    class dog : animal
    {
        public override void eat() 
	{
	  Console.WriteLine("dog can eat");
	 }
    }

For Ex-

    class program
    {
        abstract class animal
        {
            public abstract void eat();
            public void sound()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("dog can sound");
            }
        }
        class dog : animal
        {
            public override void eat() 
            {
              Console.WriteLine("dog can eat");
             }
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            dog mydog = new dog();
            animal thePet = mydog;
            thePet.eat();
            mydog.sound();
        }
    }
