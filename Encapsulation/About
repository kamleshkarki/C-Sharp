Encapsulation, in object oriented programming methodology, prevents access to implementation details.
is defined 'as the process of enclosing one or more items within a physical or logical package'.
/*
 Encapsulation is used to hide its members from outside class or interface, whereas
	1.Encapsulation is the process of hiding irrelevant data from the user.
	2.To understand encapsulation, consider an example of mobile phone. 
	3.Whenever you buy a mobile, you don’t see how circuit board works.
	4.You are also not interested to know how digital signal converts into analog signal and vice versa. 
	5.These are the irrelevant information for the mobile user,that’s why it is encapsulated inside a cabinet.
*/
Encapsulation is implemented by using access specifiers. 
An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of a class member. C# supports the following
access specifiers:
1.Public
2.Private
3.Protected
4.Internal
5.Protected internal
